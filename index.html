<p>According to the SDF, the Turkish army targeted Kobane after the visit of the US-led coalition&#8217;s officials to Ain al-Issa district in Raqqa province, where the Kurdish-led SDF troops continue their operations against ISIS militants.</p>
<p>SDF officials reported that the attacks and the Turkish army encroachment on the Syrian territory is a message to the United States, that is backing the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) despite Turkey&#8217;s opposition.</p>
